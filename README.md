# Supervised Machine Learning Lessons


This repository is intended to be a guide to supervised machine learning methods. It's composed of Jupyter Noteeboks and each
of them corrisponds to a different method. Each notebook contain a theoretical section where we give the theoretical basis
of the method under study, followed by the application and implementation of the method in Python, in particular using the scikit
library, focusing on a given dataset.

These lessons are part of the 'Machine Learning Course' of École Normale Supérieure of Paris (ENS). The theoretical part 
is augmented and integrated with the book: 'The Elements of Statistical Learning' by T.Hastie, R.Tibshirani, J.Friedman. 


The first file that is supposed to be read is Supervised_Learning.ipynb that contains the overview of the techinques used in a ML project and the models we studied in details in the other notebooks. 

The dataset we used is an already cleaned version of a dataset used to predict price of apartments in Paris. It contains 24 features plus the price of the apartment per night. The details of the dataset will be clear in the singular noteboks.
