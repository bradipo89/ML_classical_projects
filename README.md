# Supervised Machine Learning Lessons


This repository is intended to be a guide to supervised machine learning methods. It's composed of Jupyter Noteeboks and each
of them corrisponds to a different method. Each notebook contain a theoretical section where we give the theoretical basis
of the method under study, followed by the application and implementation of the method in Python, in particular using the scikit
library, focusing on a given dataset.

These lessons are part of the 'Machine Learning Course' of École Normale Supérieure of Paris (ENS). The theoretical part 
is augmented and integrated with the book: 'The Elements of Statistical Learning' by T.Hastie, R.Tibshirani, J.Friedman. 


The content of the repository is the following, and it will be updated step by step everytime a new notebook will be added:

- Supervised_Learning_Intro.pdf : Introduction Supervised Machine Learning Methods
- Linear_Regression.ipynb : Linear Methods for Regression 
- Linear_Classification.ipynb : Linear Methods for Classification
- ...[TBA]
